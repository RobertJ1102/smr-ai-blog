title: Why SMRs Are the Future of Energy Production
---

The explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in recent years has led to many advancements worldwide. However, as with fast growth, there are often a few downsides, in the case of AI/ML, it's primarily energy consumption. For reference, _The Verge_ estimates AI/ML models consume as much energy as the country of Germany (Calma). The energy usage comes from the training process of AI/ML models, which is extremely computationally expensive and, at large scales, requires power-hungry devices to efficiently compute the mathematical formulas responsible for the “magic” of these models. These extreme energy requirements currently strain existing energy infrastructure in the US, and they are predominantly powered by coal and other harmful fuel sources. A clean and more efficient energy source is required. Luckily, there is one energy source that has been around for a very long time and is known to deliver a high, steady volume of energy: nuclear power. While nuclear energy is a very viable solution, it is not perfect. Setting up a nuclear power plant is expensive and requires extensive infrastructure, which is where Small Modular Nuclear Reactors (SMRs) begin to shine. SMRs are small reactors that can be deployed on-site to meet energy needs. Given AI’s increasing energy needs, Small Nuclear Reactors offer a modular, scalable, and cost-effective solution to power data centers, addressing environmental and infrastructure concerns.

AI and ML refer to technologies that enable machines to learn and detect patterns and use these to make decisions and self-learn over time. Machine Learning is a subset of AI focused on developing algorithms that focus on learning from data without being given specific instructions like code ("Artificial Intelligence" 7). AI traditionally focuses on performing tasks that usually require a human. Both technologies require massive amounts of data and “training,” which takes a lot of computational processing power. When a model is trained, it means taking millions or billions of data points and running them through slews of mathematical formulas to adjust weights and biases, which, when given inputs, will possibly generate some desired output. The math for training comes in the form of matrix multiplication, which can be performed effectively by devices like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). These devices use an extreme amount of energy and are usually needed to run for long periods of time. To put this into perspective, Meta’s AI Llama 3 took roughly 7.7 million GPU hours to just pretrain (Meta). In terms of energy, this is the equivalent of approximately 5.4 million kWH or enough power to support over 500 average US homes for a year.

As AI technology progresses, the energy demands will also continue to increase. According to _MarketWatch_, AI data centers alone are estimated to consume around 8 terawatt hours (TWH) in 2024. They predict the number to skyrocket to 652 TWH by 2030. The following graph highlights the exponential estimate for energy consumption.

This rapid growth underscores the urgent need for a sustainable, high-output energy solution.

Given the immense power demand of AI, the limitations in the current power structure have been highlighted quite well. The dependence on fossil fuels is only going to become worse as more and more energy is required to power data centers. Additionally, many electrical grids were not designed for the kind of throughput that is required. According to Goldman Sachs, most of the current power grid infrastructure in the US is quite dated and around 40 years old.

Goldman also estimates that the data center power consumption in the US will soar to 3.3 billion cubic feet per day of new natural gas demand by 2030, meaning a further reliance on fossil fuels (_AI Is Poised to Drive 160% Increase in Data Center Power Demand_). They also claim that US cities will need to invest around $50 billion in new capacity just to support data centers. Additionally, the problem only gets worse when alternative energy solutions are investigated. Renewable energy sources are great in most circumstances but have a major flaw: these solutions predominantly rely on weather and environmental conditions. An article from _Life Powered_ puts this well:

> “The reality is stark: AI operations require uninterrupted power to function optimally. Unlike conventional electricity generation, where output can be adjusted to meet fluctuating demand, renewable sources depend on weather conditions and geographic location. This intermittency poses challenges for maintaining the stability and reliability of the power supply necessary for AI’s computational tasks, which often operate around the clock” (Oldfather).

This dependency on unpredictable weather patterns, such as wind or sunlight for wind turbines or solar panels, makes it challenging for renewable energy to meet the output demanded by data centers. While battery storage solutions exist to help resolve these fluctuations, the current technology is insufficient for long-term energy storage, and battery technology isn’t the most climate-friendly to produce, often requiring heavy metals. Furthermore, expanding renewable energy infrastructure to meet AI consumption requirements would require massive amounts of land, significant investment, and upgrades to power grids.

Given these challenges, reliance on renewables alone cannot guarantee the reliable, high-output power that AI technology demands. A more dependable energy source is paramount for a future powering AI without fossil fuels. Fortunately, nuclear power offers a compelling solution to help alleviate some or all of AI’s power problems. As mentioned earlier, nuclear energy offers a combination of high energy output, very low carbon emissions, and high reliability. Under normal running conditions, nuclear reactors provide constant power regardless of the outside weather conditions or other externalities. One key advantage of nuclear power is the incredible energy density of nuclear fuel. For instance, producing the same amount of electricity as 0.015kg of uranium would take 1000 kg of coal (Wegrzyn and Carlini). This extreme energy density means nuclear power can generate vast amounts of energy with minimum fuel and waste, making it space and waste-efficient.

In addition, nuclear power has remarkably low carbon emissions, emitting less than 50g CO₂ per kWh, which is just a small fraction of gas or coal-generated power at 450g CO₂ and 1050g CO₂, respectively. Modern nuclear reactors are also significantly safer than older designs, with new safety systems that hugely reduce the risk of accidents. However, traditional nuclear reactors face infrastructure, cost, and size challenges. The image below shows the TVA Watts Bar Nuclear Power Plant, which is enormous in size.

Constructing such a power plant is extremely costly and time-consuming, often taking years or even decades to complete. Additionally, large-scale nuclear projects often face public outcry due to concerns about nuclear materials—frequently misunderstood risks.

Fortunately, SMRs offer a perfect solution to these challenges. SMRs are an innovative advancement in nuclear energy technology, designed to be small, modular, factory-built units that can be deployed quickly and efficiently. SMRs usually produce between 50 MW and 300 MW of energy, making them highly adaptable to modern energy needs, particularly for AI data centers. SMRs provide several key advantages, making them perfect for data centers. Their modularity and scalability allow them to be delivered already constructed, significantly reducing construction time and costs. The modular design also allows for incremental expansion, making it easy to scale production to meet energy requirements. For instance, if a company opens a new wing on its data center and needs another 50 MW of energy, it could just purchase another unit and add it to its reactor array. In addition, given the size of SMRs, they are highly space-efficient and have a very small footprint, requiring much less land than traditional nuclear reactors.
